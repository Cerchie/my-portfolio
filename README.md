# portfolio-site

Welcome to my static portfolio site, whipped up with HTML + CSS and served on Netlify. :cupcake:

Resources I used to build this site:

I used this [Scrimba Portfolio tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn/portfolio) to build my old website, so there are a few bits and pieces leftover from that one, like the font awesome integration.

To make sure my navbar was responsive, I used [this helpful blog post](https://dev.to/supanthapaul/create-a-simple-navbar-with-7-lines-of-css-4h7f) by Supantha Paul, then personalized the styles.
